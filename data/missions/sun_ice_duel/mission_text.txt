Location: On the blockade perimeter of the Idoneus Citadel
Date: 213.04.12

It's been months since your last duel. A mercenary captain at the helm of an Eagle had thought your invitation laughable. He accepted, but seemingly only out of boredom. Mere minutes later the hull of your frigate was pelted with the molten debris of his midline cruiser as it exploded gloriously.

No other outsiders had accepted your challenge. The other exiled duelists were just as eager for worthy opponents, but, due to austere circumstances, they were permitted only to fight those who wished the Exiles harm. The outsiders cared little for glory, however, and would avoid single combat whenever possible.

Others have given up, joining raiding fleets or, worse yet, signing up to escort supply convoys. You, on the other hand, had decided to go back to your roots, making the long pilgrimage to Idoneus Citadel itself and summarily challenging the Admiral of the first blockade fleet you encountered. Like the mercenary, this admiral seems unconcerned by your challenge, but this time you suspect your opponents nonchalance is justified.
