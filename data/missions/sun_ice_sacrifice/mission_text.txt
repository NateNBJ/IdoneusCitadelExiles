First-hand accounts of Idoneus Citadel technology were uncommon until the Exodus. Of the few who ventured close enough to Idoneus Citadel to provoke a reaction, fewer still lived to recount the experience.

Shortly before the Exodus, an independent mercenary group brought a midsize fleet to the outskirts of the sector in search of a lucrative but frustratingly elusive bounty. They followed a false trail, however, one laid by their prey to lead them into the fatal territory near the Citadel.

What they encountered there was a highly unusual fleet, even by the standards of the Idoneus Citadel. This fleet is now believed to have been not only a task force sent to destroy the intruders, but an early field test of the Athame class frigate.
