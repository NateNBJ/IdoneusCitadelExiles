,,,,,
sun_ice_palantir,SHIP,"The silent watcher of the Idoneus Citadel Navy serves the distinctive role of a dedicated recon vessel. In spite of its inefficient phase cloak and complete lack of other defensive capabilities, the Palantir remains viable due to the low costs required to manufacture, maintain, and deploy it.",,,
sun_ice_seraph,SHIP,"Lacking the flight decks and weapon mounts of the Eidolon, the Seraph class frigate serves as the sole dedicated maintenance ship of the Idoneus Citadel Navy. Given their complete lack of defensive capability, Seraphs are only found in combat when their commander has been blindsided or inattentive.",,,
sun_ice_specter,SHIP,"The mainstay of the Idoneus Citadel Navy, the Specter is designed to fill nearly all combat roles nominally. Due to the versatility provided by its weapon slots it can often be configured to fill such roles exceptionally.",,,
sun_ice_flashghast,SHIP,"The defining feature of the Flashghast is, without question, its speed. Mindful of this, Idoneus commanders rarely use any other ship to secure objectives or intercept fleeing enemies.",,,
sun_ice_athame,SHIP,"A terrifying experimental frigate, the Athame's defining feature is the fission drill at the fore of its ridged, conical hull which allows it to burrow straight through the hulls of enemy vessels at jarringly high speeds.",,,
sun_ice_nightseer,SHIP,"The Nightseer pushes Idoneus design philosophy to the extreme. With the armament of a destroyer and an improved phase jaunt system making it more maneuverable than the vast majority of frigates, the Nightseer can weave through a battlefield with ease and claim victims at will. The nightseer's phase cloak has the unique quality of briefly creating a powerful gravity well at the point of entry into phase space, which draws in and ultimately destroys nearby ordnance.",,,
sun_ice_pentagram,SHIP,"With it's unconventional design, the Pentagram forfeits traditional tactical ideals in favor of pure brute force. Some captains swear by the strategic maneuverability provided by its tractor beam, but most follow a simpler strategy; latch on until it explodes.",,,
sun_ice_shiekwraith,SHIP,"The Shiekwraith close support destroyer provides unique point deffence capability with its Friend-or-Foe signal inversion emitter, redirecting guided missiles against its enemies. A hard-wired array of Falx beams mounted in the center of the craft provide long range shield suppression in a wide firing arc. The two claw-like struts at the fore of the Shiekwraith are often fitted with Chupacabra fusors and used to block incoming fire to compensate for its lack of built-in armor regeneration capabilities.",,,
sun_ice_soulbane,SHIP,"The archetype of the Idoneus Citadel Navy, the Soulbane exemplifies the design philosophy of maximizing speed and firepower without compromising defensive staying power. More similar to a compact cruiser than a destroyer, it can face off against vessels three times it's size.",,,
sun_ice_eidolon,SHIP,"The very essence of sustainability, the Eidolon support cruiser can fulfill the logistical and combat-support needs of a small fleet while still pulling it's weight in a fight.",,,
sun_ice_kelpie,SHIP,"Often called 'The Maw of Fenrir' by those familiar with it, the Kelpie cruiser serves an unconventional role in the fleets of Idoneus Citadel; to summarily dispatch any enemy vessels smaller than itself. The collateral damage it tends to inflict on itself and surrounding allied ships tends to discourage fleet commanders from using it unnecessarily.",,,
sun_ice_voidreaver,SHIP,"With its devastating forward-facing firepower and the ability to deflect oncoming ordnance, the Voidreaver is invincible in a one-on-one fight. To the uninitiated, it often seems not to be worth its logistical requirements, but those who have seen it in action know that what it lacks in raw power it makes up for in finesse and versatility.",,,
sun_ice_shalom,SHIP,"Not seen outside of Idoneus Citadel until the Exodus, Shalom colony ships are more akin to small orbital stations than space faring vessels. Unlike the vast majority of Idoneus ships, the Shalom is not intended for short excursions, but decade long expeditions involving thousands of people. Without these city-like behemoths to use as bases of operation, the exiles of Idoneus Citadel would have fallen into deprivation shortly after their expulsion.",,,
sun_ice_apocrypha,SHIP,"Boasting a broad suite of tactical support mechanisms, the Apocrypha exemplifies the command ship. Chief among its defining features are the built in tactical ansible and recall teleporter, which  grant any Apocrypha assisted fleet unprecedented mobility and communication capabilities. Flight decks and maintenance drones provide combat sustainability to fighters and larger craft alike, while an impressive array of missile hardpoints provide it with the capacity to further support its fleet in a variety of ways.",,,
sun_ice_abraxas,SHIP,"The Abraxas class battlecruiser combines the titanic offensive and defensive capabilities of core vessels with the agility of other Idoneus Citadel ships. Several poorly understood technologies were leveraged in the engineering of the Abraxas, resulting in several inefficiencies, but also granting a uniquely wide array of combat utility. At the core of its design, both physically and figuratively, is the Nova reactor, an experimental device which provides the ship with the tremendous source of energy required to sustain its impressively rapid armor reconstruction matrix.",,,
sun_ice_phantom_wing,SHIP,"While Phantom wings are often redundant in fleets with a typical complement of Flashghasts, they are the preferred method of rapidly securing objectives in carrier fleets. Their armament ensures dominance against all but the heaviest fighters, but falls short against larger vessels.",,,
sun_ice_poltergeist_wing,SHIP,"The Poltergeist escort fighter is often used to shore up the gaps in point defense common to the ships of Idoneus Citadel. The large, forward-facing machine gun allows them to apply  significant pressure to shielded enemies.",,,
sun_ice_stormwhisp_wing,SHIP,"A capable assault fighter, Stormwhisps roam battlefields in pairs, employing typical Idoneus Citadel methods to circumvent shields, avoid fire, and flank enemies. Without shields or armor regeneration, Stormwhisps rely on phase warp technology and the EMP of their Falx beams for survivability. Its missiles and forward-facing assault gun provide a Stormwhisp with enough high-explosive firepower to penetrate the thickest armor.",,,
sun_ice_umbra_wing,SHIP,"The Umbra class corvette bomber distinguishes itself with it's unusual defensive shell, which provides uniquely effective protection while closed. While delivering its payload however, the Umbra must open its shell, exposing its fragile internal structure and increasing damage taken by up to 500 percent.",,,
,,,,,
brown_dwarf_star,PLANET,"Brown dwarfs are substellar objects too low in mass to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion reactions in their cores, unlike main-sequence stars, which can. They occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giants and the lightest stars.",,,

sun_ice_jaunt_heavy,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Allows temporary teleportation within limited proximity, increasing turn speed for the duration.",Special,,
sun_ice_jaunt_light,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Allows temporary teleportation within limited proximity, with no delay between uses.",Special,,
sun_ice_fluxdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of maneuverability. Collisions can cause a flameout while the system is active.,Movement,,
sun_ice_fofinverter,SHIP_SYSTEM,Reprograms the FoF guidance systems of nearby missiles to home in on enemies and avoid friendlies.,Defensive,,
sun_ice_repairarmor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Repairs armor. Gradually becomes more effective the longer weapons remain unused.,Defensive,,
sun_ice_drone_mx,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys three maintenance drones to repair armor, regenerate ammo, and prevent CR degradation.",Drones (support),,
sun_ice_fissiondrill_sys,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Covers the ship in a shroud of energy that disintegrates anything it touches, allowing the ship to burrow through enemy vessels.",Offensive,,
sun_ice_inversionmatrix,SHIP_SYSTEM,Incoming damage repairs armor instead of damaging it for a brief duration.,Defensive,,
sun_ice_divebomb,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Greatly increases speed during bombing runs, greatly increasing the momentum of ordnance delivery.",Movement,,
