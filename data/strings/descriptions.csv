sun_ice_hexac,WEAPON,"Hex auto cannons are versatile weapons useful for dispatching fighters, destroying enemy missiles, and applying pressure to shielded targets.",Point Defense,,
sun_ice_flamebolt,WEAPON,"The flamebolt cannon is limited by its short range and low ammo, but it packs enough of a punch to make up for it.",Strike,,
sun_ice_scatterpd,WEAPON,"Unlike most point defense solutions, this weapon specializes in destroying large swarms of missiles all at once.",Point Defense,,
sun_ice_hypermassbomb,WEAPON,A heavy hitting bomb.,Strike,,
sun_ice_boomerang,WEAPON,A two-stage missile weapon useful for circumventing shields.,Close Support,,
sun_ice_boomerangpod,WEAPON,A two-stage missile weapon useful for circumventing shields.,Close Support,,
sun_ice_mobiusray,WEAPON,The Mobeus ray fires a manually guided curving stream of death that can completely bypass shields in the hands of a skilled gunner.,Assault,,
sun_ice_tractorbeam,WEAPON,"As the name suggests, this weapon pulls ships toward each other.",Utility,,
sun_ice_hypermassdriver,WEAPON,The kinetic force behind the hypermass driver is so great that any ship that fires it will overload and be shoved backward.,Strike,,
sun_ice_fissiondrill,WEAPON,"Covers the ship in a shroud of energy that disintegrates anything it touches, allowing the ship to burrow through enemy vessels.",Strike,,
sun_ice_fissionblade,WEAPON,Extremely short range prohibits fission blades from being used on all but the most specialized ships.,Assault,,
sun_ice_fissionblademini,WEAPON,Extremely short range prohibits fission blades from being used on all but the most specialized ships.,Assault,,
,,,,,
sun_ice_specter,SHIP,"The mainstay of the Idoneus Citadel Navy, the Specter is designed to fill nearly all combat roles nominally. Due to the versatility provided by its weapon slots it can often be configured to fill such roles exceptionally.",,,
sun_ice_flashghast,SHIP,"The defining feature of the Flashghast is, without question, its speed. Mindful of this, Idoneus commanders rarely use any other ship to secure objectives or intercept fleeing enemies.",,,
sun_ice_athame,SHIP,"A terrifying experimental frigate, the Athame's defining feature is the fission drill at the fore of its ridged, conical hull which allows it to burrow straight through the hulls of enemy vessels at jarringly high speeds.",,,
sun_ice_nightseer,SHIP,"The Nightseer pushes Idoneus design philosophy to the extreme. With the armament of a light cruiser and an improved phase system making it more maneuverable than the vast majority of frigates, the Nightseer can weave through a battlefield with ease and claim victims at will.",,,
sun_ice_pentagram,SHIP,"With it's unconventional design, the Pentagram forfeits traditional tactical ideals in favor of pure brute force. Some captains swear by the strategic maneuverability provided by its tractor beam, but most follow a simpler strategy; latch on until it explodes.",,,
sun_ice_soulbane,SHIP,"The archetype of the Idoneus Citadel Navy, the Soulbane exemplifies the design philosophy of maximizing speed and firepower without compromising defensive staying power. More similar to a compact cruiser than a destroyer, it can face off against vessels three times it's size.",,,
sun_ice_eidolon,SHIP,"The very essence sustainability, the Eidolon support cruiser can fulfill the logistical and combat-support needs of a small fleet while still pulling it's weight in a fight.",,,
sun_ice_kelpie,SHIP,"Often called 'The Maw of Fenrir' by those familiar with it, the Kelpie cruiser serves an unconventional role in the fleets of Idoneus Citadel; to summarily dispatch any enemy vessels smaller than itself. The collateral damage it tends to inflict on itself and surrounding allied ships tends to discourage fleet commanders from using it unnecessarily.",,,
sun_ice_voidreaver,SHIP,"With its devastating forward-facing firepower and the ability to deflect oncoming ordnance, the Voidreaver is invincible in a one-on-one fight. To the uninitiated, it often seems not to be worth its logistical requirements, but those who have seen it in action know that what it lacks in raw power it makes up for in finesse and versatility.",,,
sun_ice_phantom_wing,SHIP,"While Phantom wings are often redundant in fleets with a typical complement of Flashghasts, they are the preferred method of rapidly securing objectives in carrier fleets.",,,
sun_ice_poltergeist_wing,SHIP,The Poltergeist escort fighter is often used to shore up the gaps in point defense common to the ships of Idoneus Citadel.,,,
,,,,,
brown_dwarf_star,PLANET,"Brown dwarfs are substellar objects too low in mass to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion reactions in their cores, unlike main-sequence stars, which can. They occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giants and the lightest stars.",,,

sun_ice_fluxdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of maneuverability. Collisions can cause a flameout while the system is active.,Movement,Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of maneuverability. Collisions can cause a flameout while the system is active.,
sun_ice_phasewarp,SHIP_SYSTEM,A short duration phase cloak that significantly boosts speed while active.,Special,A short duration phase cloak that significantly boosts speed while active.,
sun_ice_advphasewarp,SHIP_SYSTEM,A short duration phase cloak that significantly boosts speed while active.,Special,A short duration phase cloak that significantly boosts speed while active.,
sun_ice_fofinverter,SHIP_SYSTEM,Reprograms the FoF guidance systems of nearby missiles to home in on enemies and avoid friendlies.,Defensive,Reprograms the FoF guidance systems of nearby missiles to home in on enemies and avoid friendlies.,
sun_ice_repairarmor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Repairs armor. Gradually becomes more effective the longer weapons remain unused.,Defensive,Repairs armor. Gradually becomes more effective the longer weapons remain unused.,
sun_ice_phasecloak,SHIP_SYSTEM,A phase cloak that increases top speed but reduces acceleration.,Special,A phase cloak that increases top speed but reduces acceleration.,
sun_ice_drone_mx,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys three maintenance drones to repair armor, regenerate ammo, and prevent CR degradation.",Drones (support),"Deploys three maintenance drones to repair armor, regenerate ammo, and prevent CR degradation.",
sun_ice_fissiondrill,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Covers the ship in a shroud of energy that dissentegrates anything it touches, allowing the ship to burrow through enemy vessels.",Offensive,"Covers the ship in a shroud of energy that dissentegrates anything it touches, allowing the ship to burrow through enemy vessels.",
sun_ice_inversionmatrix,SHIP_SYSTEM,Incoming damage repairs armor instead of damaging it for a brief duration.,Defensive,Incoming damage repairs armor instead of damaging it for a brief duration.,
