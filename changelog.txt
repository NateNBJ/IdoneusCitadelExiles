
----<  ICE version 0.3.2   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS FIXED
- All events associated with the colony fleet are now forced to end when it is destroyed, which should prevent
many issues, including a crash
- Notifications about the exiled colony fleet event will no longer be displayed in the intel screen when they
are older than the week/month/cycle filter allows


----<  ICE version 0.3.1   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTENT CHANGES
- Idoneus Citadel is now located in Eos

BALANCE CHANGES
- Reduced ammo regeneration rate of maintenance drones to one third of previous rate

BUGS FIXED
- No longer corrupts save files


----<  ICE version 0.3.0   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please Note: This version of ICE corrupts save files...

ADDITIONS
- New mechanic added for the Exiled Idoneus Colony Fleet allowing it to merge with and detach smaller fleets
	- Pursuit fleets will now detach from the colony fleet to run down enemy fleets it can't catch
	- Vagrant fleets will now spawn from Idoneus Citadel, make their way to the colony fleet, and merge with it
	- Lone duellists will occasionally branch off and terrorize the locals for a while
	- These merges and separations follow the Law of Conservation of Matter and Energy, meaning the destruction
	of ships in these smaller fleets weakens the colony fleet because those ships won't be able to merge with it
- The two randomized missions have been re-added

CONTENT CHANGES
- The Recall Teleporter is now a streamlined hullmod rather than an obtuse weapon
- Exiled Idoneus Colony Fleets now spawns with vanilla logistics ships
- Maintenance drones are now bigger and easier to hit, with a new sprite

BALANCE CHANGES
- Maintenance drone phase cloaks now have a 2 second warm-up and cooldown time, during which they are vulnerable
- Increased phase warp cooldown of Stormwhisps from 1 to 3 seconds
- Abraxas armor regeneration now scales proportionally to CR, meaning an Abraxas with 0% CR won't regen at all

BUGS FIXED
- Exiled Idoneus Colony Fleet will no longer send trade notifications while in a system other than the player
- Idoneus factions now offer bounties for both general enemies and specific fleets
- Loaded missiles now become semi-transparent with the rest of the ship during phase jaunt


----<  ICE version 0.2.0   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please Note: This version of ICE is completely broken

ADDITIONS
- Full compatibility with Starsector 0.65
- A huge nomadic colony fleet with a fully functional market
- A custom event with multiple stages concerning aforementioned colony fleet
- A custom market condition that increases the stability of the colony fleet based on it's size
- New custom sounds for Chapucabra and Nosferatu Fusor weapons

BUGS FIXED
- Weapon barrels now become semi-transparent with the rest of the ship during phase jaunt
- Damage decals are now rendered on the top section the Nightseer's armor

AI IMPROVEMENTS
- Autofire AI for the Recall Teleporter should now be much more responsive to new assignments

BALANCE CHANGES
- Doubled the price of all ships to reflect Starsector 0.65 changes
- Greatly increased the deployment cost of all fighter wings to reflect Starsector 0.65 changes


----<  ICE version 0.1.0   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTENT ADDITIONS
- Two new Missions added

CONTENT CHANGES
- Updated the ICE ships that appear in the simulator
- Fleets with many fighters and no carriers now spawn less frequently
- Seraphs (tugs) have been removed from the Refugee fleet to limit its maximum burn
- Notifications about the Idoneus Refugee Fleet have been added to Campaign mode

BALANCE CHANGES
+ Seraph fuel/ly reduced from 12 to 9
- Nosferatu Fusor ammo regen rate reduced from 0.25 to 0.18 ammo per second
+ Eidolon deceleration increased from 30 to 45
+ Abraxas hitpoints increased from 3750 to 6500
= Apocrypha:
	+ deceleration increased from 9 to 14
	- Max burn reduced from 3 to 2
+ Soulbane deceleration increased from 60 to 75
- Shalom:
	- Max burn reduced from 2 to 1
	- OP reduced from 40 to 30
	- Unstable Injector replaced with Blast Doors on standard variant
- Tactical Ansible base CP regeneration rate decreased from 3 per minute to 1 per minute
+ Athame:
	+ Removed increase to weapon damage taken while Fission Drill is active
	+ Increased armor from 200 to 250
	+ Increased flux dissipation from 200 to 250
	+ Fission Drill flux build-up reduced by 25%

BUGS FIXED
- Idoneus Citadel and Refugee Fleets now restock ships and items again. This feature was accidentally removed
- Maintenance Drones no longer have an unused LR PD Laser
- Maintenance Drones no longer prioritize drones or fighters when targeted by their mother ship
- Ships hit by falx beams will now dissipate hard flux as originally intended, rather than instantly gaining 100% hard flux dissipation
- A few typos have been corrected. Apparently I'm predisposed to putting an 'e' where there should be an 'i'
- Stormwhisp description no longer erroneously lists Boomerang SRMs as one of its weapons
- Removed minor artefacts from Kelpie and Abraxas sprites
- Base value of Nosferatu Fusor increased from 1500  to 18000
- Phase Jaunt shadows/doppelgangers now push away nearby objects as originally intended.

AI IMPROVEMENTS
- ICE ships should now be smarter about when to use phase cloaks to speed up travel
- Phase Jaunt AI:
	- Should now be smarter about avoiding damage
	- Will now try to line up an enemy in front of the jaunting ship during flameout


----<  ICE version 0.0.2   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BALANCE CHANGES
- Ship prices adjusted. Notably, the value of the Palantir was reduced from 15000 to 1250
- Nerfed Palantir a bit to make it easier to kill

BUGS FIXED
- Transferring command to an Athame no longer has a risk of reducing its top speed
- Fission Drill AI is better about committing to a charge. It won't toggle off at inopportune times as often
- Removed mechanic from the Palantir that caused to to generate flux more quickly while cloaked near objectives
- Randomized missions no longer try to select factions without ships, which would previously cause the game to freeze
- Stability improvements. Should prevent a crash that I couldn't reproduce


----<  ICE version 0.0.1   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS FIXED
- Randomized missions no longer crash when Interstellar Imperium is selected as one of the factions
- Phase cloak cooldown sound effect no longer plays for non-ICE ships
