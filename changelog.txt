BUGS FIXED
- Idoneus Citadel and Refugee Fleets now restock ships and items again. This feature was accidentally removed
- Maintenance Drones no longer have an unused LR PD Laser
- Maintenance Drones no longer prioritize drones or fighters when targeted by their mother ship
- Ships hit by falx beams will now dissipate hard flux as originally intended, rather than instantly gaining 100% hard flux dissipation
- A few typos have been corrected. Apparently I'm predisposed to putting an 'e' where there should be an 'i'
- Stormwhisp description no longer erroneously lists Boomerang SRMs as one of its weapons
- Removed minor artefacts from Kelpie and Abraxas sprites
- Base value of Nosferatu Fusor increased from 1500  to 18000
- Phase Jaunt shadows/doppelgangers now push away nearby objects as originally intended.

AI IMPROVEMENTS
- ICE ships should now be smarter about when to use phase cloaks to speed up travel
- Phase Jaunt AI:
	- Should now be smarter about avoiding damage
	- Will now try to line up an enemy in front of the jaunting ship during flameout


----<  ICE version 0.0.2   >------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BALANCE CHANGES
- Ship prices adjusted. Notably, the value of the Palantir was reduced from 15000 to 1250
- Nerfed Palantir a bit to make it easier to kill

BUGS FIXED
- Transferring command to an Athame no longer has a risk of reducing its top speed
- Fission Drill AI is better about committing to a charge. It won't toggle off at inopportune times as often
- Removed mechanic from the Palantir that caused to to generate flux more quickly while cloaked near objectives
- Randomized missions no longer try to select factions without ships, which would previously cause the game to freeze
- Stability improvements. Should prevent a crash that I couldn't reproduce
