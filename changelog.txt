ICE version 0.0.2

BALANCE CHANGES
- Ship prices adjusted. Notably, the value of the Palantir was reduced from 15000 to 1250
- Nerfed Palantir a bit to make it easier to kill.

BUGS FIXED
- Transferring command to an Athame no longer has a risk of reducing its top speed.
- Fission Drill AI is better about committing to a charge. It won't toggle off at inopportune times as often.
- Removed mechanic from the Palantir that caused to to generate flux more quickly while cloaked near objectives.
- Randomized missions no longer try to select factions without ships, which would previously cause the game to freeze.
- Stability improvements. Should prevent a crash that I couldn't reproduce.
